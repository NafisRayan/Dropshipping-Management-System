Hi

Prompt Im using:

Build a fullstack enterprise-grade dropshipping management system using NestJS for the backend with RESTful APIs, TypeORM for database modeling, and SQLite as the development database. The frontend should be built using Next.js with ShadCN UI components for a modern, responsive interface. Implement core modules including user and role management with JWT-based authentication, product management with CRUD operations and supplier API integration, order management with status tracking and auto-forwarding, inventory synchronization via scheduled jobs, shipping and fulfillment tracking, customer management with order history, and reporting dashboards for analytics. The backend should use NestJS modules, DTOs, guards, and validation with class-validator, while the frontend should consume the REST API using Axios and include pages for dashboard, products, orders, customers, and authentication. Bonus features may include PDF invoice generation, email notifications, multi-store support, and webhook integration for real-time updates.

## AI Activity Log

### Session: October 29, 2025
  - Set up project structure (backend/frontend folders)
  - Initialized NestJS backend with CLI
  - Installed backend dependencies (TypeORM, SQLite, JWT, class-validator, etc.)
  - Configured TypeORM with SQLite database
  - Implemented authentication module (User/Role entities, JWT auth, guards, DTOs)
  - Implemented product management (CRUD operations, DTOs, guards)
  - Implemented order management (CRUD with status tracking, DTOs)
  - Initialized Next.js frontend with ShadCN UI
  - Installed frontend dependencies (Axios, React Hook Form)
  - Created auth pages (login/register with JWT handling)
  - Built basic dashboard page
  - Integrated Axios for API calls
  - Added CORS support to backend
  - Created detailed README.md
  - Updated KeepTrack.md with activity log

  - Implement inventory sync (scheduled jobs)
  - Implement shipping/fulfillment tracking
  - Implement customer module
  - Implement reporting API
  - Build products page with CRUD interface
  - Build orders page with status tracking
  - Build customers page
  - Implement bonus features (PDF invoices, email, multi-store, webhooks)

  - Backend running on port 3000
  - Frontend running on port 3001
  - Database: SQLite (database.sqlite)
  - Auth: JWT with bcrypt hashing
  - UI: ShadCN components with Tailwind CSS
  - API endpoints protected with JWT guards
  
- **Runtime Test (user executed)**:
  - A runtime test was executed from a separate PowerShell (not the backend shell).
  - Register attempt returned validation error: `role must be one of the following values: admin, user`.
  - Login attempt returned `Internal server error` (500) — caused by generic Error being thrown in the auth service on invalid credentials.
  - Port check shows backend is listening on port 3000 and has at least one established connection.

- **Immediate Fixes Applied (by AI)**:
  1. **Make `role` optional in `RegisterDto`**
     - File: `backend/src/auth/dto/register.dto.ts`
     - Change: added `@IsOptional()` decorator to `role` so registration without `role` succeeds.
  2. **Return proper HTTP error for failed login**
     - File: `backend/src/auth/auth.service.ts`
     - Change: replaced generic `Error('Invalid credentials')` with `UnauthorizedException('Invalid credentials')` so login failures return HTTP 401 instead of 500.

- **Remaining Tasks (short-term)**:
  - Re-run the runtime tests (register/login/products) from a new PowerShell (not backend shell) to confirm fixes.
  - If registration succeeds but login still fails, inspect database contents (`database.sqlite`) and logs for more details.

- **Technical Notes**:
  - Backend running on port 3000 (confirmed listening)
  - Frontend running on port 3001 (if started)
  - Database: SQLite (`database.sqlite`)
  - Auth: JWT with bcrypt hashing
  - UI: ShadCN components with Tailwind CSS
  - API endpoints protected with JWT guards

### Next Steps
1. Re-test register/login flow in a separate PowerShell (NOT the backend shell). See re-test commands below.
2. If all passes, continue with inventory sync and other remaining features.

### Quick re-test PowerShell script (run in a NEW shell)
```powershell
$body = @{ email='test@example.com'; password='password' } | ConvertTo-Json
try { $r = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://localhost:3000/auth/register' -Method POST -ContentType 'application/json' -Body $body -ErrorAction Stop; Write-Output "REGISTER_RESPONSE:`n"; $r | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5 } catch { Write-Output "REGISTER_FAILED: $_" }
try { $login = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://localhost:3000/auth/login' -Method POST -ContentType 'application/json' -Body $body -ErrorAction Stop; Write-Output "LOGIN_RESPONSE:`n"; $login | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5 } catch { Write-Output "LOGIN_FAILED: $_" }
try { $tok = $login.access_token; if (-not $tok) { $tok = $r.access_token } ; if ($tok) { Write-Output "TOKEN_PRESENT"; Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://localhost:3000/products' -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer $tok" } -Method GET | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5 } else { Write-Output 'NO_TOKEN' } } catch { Write-Output "PRODUCTS_CALL_FAILED: $_" } ; Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -Property LocalAddress,LocalPort,State,OwningProcess
```

### AI Runtime Test (executed: October 29, 2025)

- **What I ran**: `scripts/runtime_test.ps1` in a NEW PowerShell; this script attempts register -> login -> GET /products -> port check.

- **Results**:
  - Register: SUCCESS — returned `access_token`.
  - Login: SUCCESS — returned `access_token`.
  - Products GET: returned an empty list (no products in DB yet).
  - Port check: backend listening on port 3000 (one or more connections established).

- **Raw highlights**:
  - REGISTER_RESPONSE contained an `access_token` (JWT).
  - LOGIN_RESPONSE contained an `access_token` (same token returned here).
  - PRODUCTS call returned an empty array (Count: 0).
  - TCP listener entries observed for port 3000 (IPv6/IPv4 entries).

- **Next actions**:
  1. Create a product via `POST /products` (authenticated) to confirm product creation and then `GET /products` returns it.
  2. Proceed to implement inventory sync, shipping, customer, and reporting modules (remaining work on the todo list).

**Note about running changes**: I updated the `ProductsController` to make `GET /products` public and protect create/update/delete with the JWT guard. For that change to be active you need to restart the backend dev server (the running Nest process must reload). Please restart the backend in the backend PowerShell so the updated controller is picked up.
